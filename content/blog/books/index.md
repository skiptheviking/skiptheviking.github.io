[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=skiptheviking-20&linkId=6649d19eb218bc766ae4b5cb570efe61)
 by Robert C. Martin

Do you want to write clean code? You cannot go wrong with this book. "Uncle Bob's"
writing style is by far my favorite.  He has 50 years (50 YEARS!!!!) of writing code
experience, so you cannot ignore his advice. I'm a big fan.

[The Effective Engineer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=skiptheviking-20&linkId=6649d19eb218bc766ae4b5cb570efe61) by Edmond Lau

START with this book.  This is a red pill / blue pill scenerio.  If you want to know
how things are done right, read this book.  Or stay in the matrix and
keep with the status quo.
