For those of you with a spouse working, 
how much money are they really bringing into the family? You might think whatever the paycheck is,
and you would be wrong come tax time.

And you might think they are taxed at your marginal tax rate. Again, you would be wrong. As was I.

You see, I was given the opportunity last year to work additional hours at my company
for additional pay.  And my doctor wife who works PRN (as needed) also controls how many hours
she works. 

Now my additional hours were not time and half - just paid time. And my wife's PRN hours are just
a normal rate as well.  But like many in our generation, we are always looking for a side hustle to 
try to get ahead (or catch up - however you want to look at it)

Anyways, one day I took the time to understand how much of the additional hours we were working
were getting taxed.  After I conducted the analysis - I didn't come in for extra hours one more time.
Nor did I have my wife work any more PRN hours.

Why? Hidden taxes.  Or as I long to call it, the REAL marginal tax rate.

Would you work weekends if 90 percent went to the government? How about 50 percent? Well, 
it came out to be about 45 percent for me.

How can this be? I must making a killing to be in such a high tax rate?

Nope.  Not really.
