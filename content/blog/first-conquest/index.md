When the emissary's came to the Viking lands and
asked to speak to their leader, the Viking responded: "We are all leaders here".

And this is exactly how Software Engineers need to be.  

You've stumbled across Skip the Viking, a software architect journeyman
who is on a "raid" to become a master software architect.

Why architect and not just engineer?

There shouldn't be much of a difference in terms of skill set, but an
architect takes ownership of the design of a system.  And should be working 
at a higher scale.

That being said, I've seen people hide behind the title architect to mean
they no longer have nuts and bolts technical skills.  That is not me.

I write code. Lots of code. And I'm constantly trying to become a better programmer.  Check
out my library [here](/books).  And yes, these are affiliate links, so if you buy one of these books I'll get paid.
Good, that means you can help me stop being a [code prostitute](/code-hooker).
