description: How working as a software engineer is like being a prostitute
---

Last summer I was applying for new jobs (something I do regularly, more on that later).  As usual, people 
love my resume so we set up a time to talk.  Except I'm not talking with the customer.  Nor am I talking with
any of the engineers.  I'm talking with the "talent acquisition" portion of the company.

TA: So are you a software architect?

Me: Well yeah, I design and build software.  That term is thrown around a lot, 
can you be more specific on the context?

TA: No that's great, the customer wants the person to be a software architect.

TA: So do you know Java?

Me: Yep, I just spend the last year and half building ETL systems in Java that are being used in production
and helped meet mission critical needs. What particulars are you looking for?

TA: Ok great, yeah, they want someone who knows Java


 *And so on and so forth, they continued to ask questions about "skills" that I might have
because that's what the customer wants.*

So in the end they want to hire me and we start talking salary.  Now
they wanted to hire me as an employee because employees are more "loyal" (barf - loyalty is earned by being loyal to your employee - 
not based on the payment arrangement).  

And they wanted me to work on site in their office.  But there customer was remote in another city. And the team I'd be working
with were also in other cities.  So I'd have to relocate to work on site in the office, ***TO THEN WORK REMOTELY***

So I'm already feeling like they want a whole lot and are giving very little.

But I start asking about the business model, and it's all too familiar.  The "business" finds a customer who needs some
software built, system upgrading, etc...  basically some sort of "service".

So they hire someone else to provide that service.  They charge the customer rates of 250, 300, even 500 an hour - and pay the engineer
somewhere between 40 - 60 an hour (sometimes lower...)

And it dawned on me what other business follows the EXACT same business model:

Prostitution!

The "business" is the pimp, the "customer" is the customer, and I get to be the code hooker!!! Yay!!!!

I realized my current job was this model, and pretty much every job I was applying to was this model.

I mean, all the interview questions might as well be "are you a blonde? They want a blonde" And I'm dying my hair blonde er 
ugh updating my resume to reflect some trait that particular job wants.

I mean I'm freaking software engineer! I solve problems in software for a living! And I'm good at it! Is it really that important whether
I've worked with the exact set of esoteric technology that your company uses at that point in time? I mean half the shit they list
on job descriptions they don't even do.  Don't even get me started on scrum...

Bottom line, I realized my job hopping was just upgrading pimps.  Long term, I need to get into a different business model.  Business don't just use software
like the use toilet paper, for a lot of businesses, software IS the business.  Don't believe me? How long could the business run if all the software and data
was destroyed? This has happened before and those businesses were shutdown for good the next day.

For something of that value, I want to be a partner.  I want to build software that helps the business be successful, and share in the profits.  Almost
all other creative professionals have some sort of royalty on their creative work.  Software engineers have been taking only a small cut of their actual
value.  And when we bill hourly, we are only incentivitized to waste time?!  

So this blog is part of my long term goal to not be a code hooker, but rather an owner.  I want to own my source code I write, reuse it to help businesses,
and come to a win win solution where the business does better and I do better!  If you need someone like that then [contact me!](/contact)
