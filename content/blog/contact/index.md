*Freelancer? Consultant? Contractor?* YES!

I've automated onboarding systems for enterprise resource planning systems.  

I've built interactive webapps for generating reports, monitoring complex systems,
and producing scientific output.

I've built ETL pipelines transforming manufacturing data into databases.

I've written simple automated scripts in a day that replaced daily manual tasks for perpetuity saving THOUSANDS of man hours.

Backends, frontends, middleware, you name it....

There is a pretty good chance I can solve your IT/ Software / Data problem.  And if I can't, I can usually give you a good idea
of who can.

Am I desperate for work? Not even close. I have no shortage of work.  But if you have an interesting problem
that needs to be solved or just some consulting on how to do something, contact me and we can set something up.

***How much do you charge per hour?***

I don't charge hourly ([see code prostitution](/code-hooker)).  I charged based on value (my time and yours).  Is this automation going to save your company
20k per year? Would you be willing to spend 5k to get it in production? You get a deliverable for a fixed price and I get to 
leverage my industry knowledge to build it for you as efficiently as possibly.  We all win.  This only works if your requirements
are clear (or at least mostly clear - in software requirements ALWAYS evolve).  We can talk more about this. But send me an email and let's see
if we can come up with a arrangement
