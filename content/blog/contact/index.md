Freelancer? Consultant? Contractor? YES!

I've automated onboarding systems for enterprise resource planning systems.  

I've built interactive webapps for generating reports, monitoring complex systems,
and producing scientific output.

I've built ETL pipelines transforming manufacturing data into databases.

I've written simple automated scripts in a day that replaced daily manual tasks for perpetuity saving THOUSANDS of man hours.

Backends, frontends, middleware, you name it....

There is a pretty good chance I can solve your IT/ Software / Data problem.  And if I can't, I can usually give you a good idea
of who can.

Am I desperate for work? Not even close. I have no shortage of work.  But if you have an interesting problem
that needs to be solved or just some consulting on how to do something, contact me and we can set something up.
