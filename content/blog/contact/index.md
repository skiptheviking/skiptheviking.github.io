*Automations, apps, and integrations for businesses on a budget*

###What can Viking Software do for me?

* Integrate your existing applications
* Build web apps with business intelligence / reporting
* Automate routine or rules-based tasks
* Consulting services for software needs
* Systems design and architecture

###Professional Experience

* Automated onboarding systems for enterprise resource planning systems.  
* Built interactive webapps for generating reports, monitoring complex systems,
and producing scientific output.
* Designed and built ETL pipelines transforming manufacturing data into databases.
* Written simple automated scripts in a day that replaced daily manual tasks for perpetuity saving THOUSANDS of man hours.
* Integrated disparate systems to produce actionable business intelligence
* Full stack web development
* Business data modeling and database design, construction, and optimization

###Cost

I don't charge hourly ([see code prostitution](/code-hooker)).  Cost is value based (my time and yours). 
Are willing to spend 10k on an automation that will save you 20k yearly? You get your agreed upon upfront deliverable for a fixed price and I get to 
leverage my industry knowledge to build it for you as efficiently as possibly.  We all win.  This only works if your requirements
are clear (or at least mostly clear - in software requirements ALWAYS evolve).
