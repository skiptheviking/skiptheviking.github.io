A lot. From people who know  what they are talking about. Yes, I learn a ton working\nand from personal experience. But books allow you to learn from other people’s experiences,\noften decades more experience.  It’s awesome when you can find a good mentor,\nand good books allow you to acquire yourself some of the best\nmentors in the industry for a nominal price by reading their most comprehensive thoughts.</p>\n<p>Below are some of my current book recommendations:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;creativeASIN=0132350882&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=skiptheviking-20&#x26;linkId=6649d19eb218bc766ae4b5cb570efe61\">Clean Code</a>\nby Robert C. Martin</p>\n<p>Do you want to write clean code? You cannot go wrong with this book. Robert C. Martin\naka Uncle Bob has one of my favorite writing styles.  And he has 50 years (50 YEARS!!!!) of writing code\nexperience, so you cannot go wrong with his advice.  It is tried and true.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;creativeASIN=0132350882&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=skiptheviking-20&#x26;linkId=6649d19eb218bc766ae4b5cb570efe61\">The Effective Engineer</a> by Edmond Lau</p>\n<p>START with this book if you want to be an effective engineer.  This is a red pill / blue pill scenario.  If you want to know\nhow things are done right, read this book.  Or stay in the matrix and\nkeep with the status quo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37MwiFT\">The Systems Bible</a>\nby John Gall</p>\n<p>A MUST read.  Before you build software you must understand how systems work. What do I mean by systems?\nEverything is a system.  And all systems have inherent properties.  Every system wants to expand\nto fill the known universe.  Only simple systems work.  Complex systems that work only work because\nthey are composed of simpler systems.  These principles and much more are found in this book\nin often humorous (but true) examples.  You won’t be able to put this one down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2urvesI\">Clean Architecture</a>\nby Robert C. Martin</p>\n<p>You want clean architecture? Invert your code dependencies towards least change. How do I know this? This book!\nAnother hit from Uncle Bob - this is a must read if you want to design a system that is flexible and maintanable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/37S86SS\">The Maxwell Leadership Bible</a></p>\n<p>Yes, I’m getting religious on you. This is the NKJV version of the bible with commentary\nfrom John C. Maxwell, one of the best writers on leadership.  I have yet to read one thing\nfrom his commentary that hasn’t helped me in the workplace be a better leader.  Remember, leadership\nand management are different things.  Not everyone is a manager, but everyone ought to <a href=\"/first-raid\">be a leader</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Professional Book Recommendations","date":"January 04, 2020","description":"For the aspiring software connoisseur"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/books/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/tax-estimator-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design a tax estimating app"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/code-hooker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"High Class Code Prostitution"}}}}}
