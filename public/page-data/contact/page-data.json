YES!</p>\n<p>I’ve automated onboarding systems for enterprise resource planning systems.  </p>\n<p>I’ve built interactive webapps for generating reports, monitoring complex systems,\nand producing scientific output.</p>\n<p>I’ve built ETL pipelines transforming manufacturing data into databases.</p>\n<p>I’ve written simple automated scripts in a day that replaced daily manual tasks for perpetuity saving THOUSANDS of man hours.</p>\n<p>Backends, frontends, middleware, you name it…</p>\n<p>There is a pretty good chance I can solve your IT/ Software / Data problem.  And if I can’t, I can usually give you a good idea\nof who can.</p>\n<p>Am I desperate for work? Not even close. I have no shortage of work.  But if you have an interesting problem\nthat needs to be solved or just some consulting on how to do something, contact me and we can set something up.</p>\n<p>Email me at <a href=\"mailto:skip\">skip@skiptheviking.com</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>How much do you charge per hour?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I don’t charge hourly (<a href=\"/code-hooker\">see code prostitution</a>).

You get a deliverable for a fixed price and I get to\nleverage my industry knowledge to build it for you as efficiently as possibly.  We all win.  This only works if your requirements\nare clear (or at least mostly clear - in software requirements ALWAYS evolve).  We can talk more about this. But send me an email and let’s see\nif we can come up with a good arrangement!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Contact Me","date":null,"description":"Side hustling software architect"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/contact/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/books/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Know My Shit"}},"next":null}}}
