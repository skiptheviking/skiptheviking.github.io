You might think whatever the paycheck is,\nand you would be wrong come tax time.</p>\n<p>And you might think they are taxed at your marginal tax rate. Again, you would be wrong. As was I.</p>\n<p>You see, I was given the opportunity last year to work additional hours at my company\nfor additional pay.  And my doctor wife who works PRN (as needed) also controls how many hours\nshe works. </p>\n<p>Now my additional hours were not time and half - just paid time. And my wife’s PRN hours are just\na normal rate as well.  But like many in our generation, we are always looking for a side hustle to\ntry to get ahead (or catch up - however you want to look at it)</p>\n<p>Anyways, one day I took the time to understand how much of the additional hours we were working\nwere getting taxed.  After I conducted the analysis - I didn’t come in for extra hours one more time.\nNor did I have my wife work any more PRN hours.</p>\n<p>Why? Hidden taxes.  Or as I long to call it, the REAL marginal tax rate.</p>\n<p>Would you work weekends if 90 percent went to the government? How about 50 percent? Well,\nit came out to be about 45 percent for me.</p>\n<p>How can this be? I must making a killing to be in such a high tax rate?</p>\n<p>Nope.  Not really.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I won't let my doctor wife work","date":"January 02, 2020","description":"Exposing the hidden income tax bracket of 45 percent"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/why-I-wont-let-my-doctor-wife-work/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-conquest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The First Conquest"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/tax-estimator-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design a tax estimating app"}}}}}
